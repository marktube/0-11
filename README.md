# 0-11

This is an implemention of board game Da Vinci Code on iOS.

#### Game introduction

- 26 number cards:
0-11 in white color
0-11 in black color
joker in white color
joker in black color
(joker can be used as any number, denote as '-')

- At least 2 players(5 most?)

- Each player takes 4 numeric cards at begining and keep it secret

- Each player sorts own numeric cards in ascending order from left to right

- Each player now only knows own numbers and others' back(color) of cards

- Choose 1 player to start his or her turn

- The player takes 1 number card from the remaining cards pile

- The player then choose another player and try to guess the number of one choosen player's card

- If the player guesses the wrong number, then he or she must show the numeric card previously taken to all

- If guess successfully, the card should be shown to all, and the player can try to guess another one more time or take the new number card to his hand without showing it to all

- The cards in hands should always be sorted including known cards

- One player ends his or her turn, next palyer starts.

- The player lose his or her game when all his or her cards are known to all 

#### Implement 

I plan to implement a 2 players version first. Use bluetooth to connect devices. More details to be continued.
